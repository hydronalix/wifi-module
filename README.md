# Hydronalix WiFi telemetry diagnostics thing

a simple way of connecting to a USV to see onboard telemetry data. in short, the board acts as a WiFi access point from which the user can connect to view a basic webpage that:   
* displays vehicle health and lifetime data    
* accepts client input for configuration     
and, if it's reasonable:   
* allows simple file transfer   
* connects to greater WAN networks to relay health stats to a cloud server, to track asset statuses (!!!)

## hardware overview

* arduino nano 33 IoT (includes ublox NINA-W102 onboard)  
* microSD slot connected to arduino's SPI line  
* mag switch  
* other peripherals (TODO)  

## TODO
* port ESP32 webserver (including POST/GET functionality)
* port teensy SD functionality to arduino   
* creat sysdiag (for here!) and write/port peripheral code   

## other ideas n stuffs
* ability to download logfiles from SD over WiFi  
* cloud connectivity via cellphone or some other WAN when not being used as a webserver
